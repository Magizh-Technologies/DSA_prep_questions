# Given a binary matrix, find the maximum size rectangle binary-sub-matrix with all 1â€™s. 

# Example: 

# Input:
# 0 1 1 0
# 1 1 1 1
# 1 1 1 1
# 1 1 0 0

# Output :
# 8

# Explanation : 
# The largest rectangle with only 1's is from 
# (1, 0) to (2, 3) which is
# 1 1 1 1
# 1 1 1 1 
# and area is 4 *2 = 8.

# Solution

# Word Search

# Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. 
# The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

# Example 1:
# Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
# Output: true

# Example 3:
# Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
# Output: false

# Valid Palindrome

# https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/

# A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

# Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
# Output: true
# Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "race a car"
# Output: false
# Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

# Solution:
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Filter out non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
        s = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
        
        # Check if the filtered string is equal to its reverse
        return s == s[::-1]
